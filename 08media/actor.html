            <figcaption>Steven Robertson playing Detective Sandy Wilson<br> Sandy is a dedicated detective constable with a strong sense of right and wrong, but in season 6 his feelings for Kate Kilmuir occasionally clouded his judgement and got him into trouble. His knowledge of the local area and community makes him a key member of the team.
                he has said that one of the things he loves most about filming in the Shetland islands where he was born and grew up is that he can speak in the Shetland dialect. When he uses the dialect and some Shetland words down south, nobody can understand him.</figcaption>
